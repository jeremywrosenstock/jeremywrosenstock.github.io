    <div class = "textbox">
        <p>Jeremy Rosenstock is a composer and pianist based in Los Angeles, California. His principal teachers and mentors include Wolfgang Von Schweinitz, Tim Feeney, Clay Chaplin, Stan Link, Michael Slayton, Michael Alec Rose, Craig Nies, and Gabriela Lena Frank. As a composer, Jeremy has taken lessons with Dan Trueman, Sarah Kirkland Snyder, Andrea Mazzariello, Suzanne Farrin, Gabriela Lena Frank, David Conte, and Benjamin Boyle. He participated in So Percussion Summer Institute in 2019, where his quartet was read and recorded by So Percussion; Cortona Sessions for New Music (2017-2020), where his new work for soprano and violin was premiered by Duo Cortona in the summer of 2020; Stanford University’s CCRMA Summer Workshops (2017-2018), and the European-American Musical Alliance’s Nadia Boulanger Institute (2018). In 2021, he will be participating in the Gabriela Lena Frank Academy of Music’s Flute Masterclass, where he will be working with the namesake composer as well as flutists Nathalie Joachim and Ray Furuta. 
        </p>
        <p>As an undergraduate at Vanderbilt University’s Blair School of Music, Jeremy co-founded the Eschaton Ensemble, a student-run chamber group dedicated to the performance of new music. The group received an ensemble fellowship at the 2018 Cortona Sessions, premiering and performing numerous works by living composers (including his own) on piano and laptop. He was selected as a Semi-Finalist in 2019 for the Fulbright Program in Music Composition. </p>
        <p>Jeremy is currently pursuing an MFA in Experimental Sound Practices at CalArts, where his artistic interests range from just intonation and drawing graphic scores by hand to the use of ice and multi-channel feedback systems (via Max/MSP) in sound art. His EP, cairns, book four, came out on People Places Records on October 2, 2020; he is excited to have his work included in the Winter 2020 Edition of Off Latch Zine.
